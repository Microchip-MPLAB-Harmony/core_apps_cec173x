# USART driver asynchronous - UART echo

This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode.

## Description

This example uses the USART driver in asynchronous mode in Bare-Metal environment to communicate over the console. It receives and echo's back the characters entered by the user.

- Connect the USB port P2 on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. The console displays the following message

    ![output](images/output_async_usart_echo.png)

5. Type a line of characters and press the Enter key (*NOTE: Number of characters entered before pressing enter key must be less than 256*))
6. Entered line will be echoed back and the LED is toggled
7. The following table provides the LED names
